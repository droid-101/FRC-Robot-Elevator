# FRC Robot Elevator

CAD models for a two-stage continuous lift for FIRST Robotics Competition robots. This system is designed to lift objects and robot mechanisms. Stages move by clamping onto sidebars or other stages using sliders with rollers. This allows them to freely slide up and down the rails on which they lie. This model has also been constructed out of simple commerial-off-the-shelf items which all FRC teams will have access to.
